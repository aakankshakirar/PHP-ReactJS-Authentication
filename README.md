# PHP-ReactJS-Authentication
Our Authentication App is built to give users safe access to their accounts with key features like registration, login, profile management, and profile picture uploads. We've used vanilla PHP and ReactJS to make it work smoothly, blending server-side functions with interactive client-side features for an easy-to-use experience.
